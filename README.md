# CryptoGUI: A Secure Text Encryption and Steganography Tool

CryptoGUI is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The application also utilizes steganography techniques to hide encrypted text within image files.

# Features:

Modern and Intuitive UI: The application features a sleek and modern user interface designed with a dark theme, using black and green colors to enhance visibility and aesthetics. The Equilux theme provides a visually appealing and comfortable experience.

# Encryption:
Users can easily encrypt their text input using AES encryption. The application prompts users to enter the text they want to encrypt and securely hides the encrypted text within an image file of their choice.

# Decryption:
The decryption feature allows users to retrieve the original text from an image file containing hidden encrypted data. Users select the image file, and the application decrypts and displays the extracted text.

# Dynamic Text Input Dialog:
The text input dialog dynamically adjusts to the overall theme, providing a consistent and seamless experience. Users are prompted to enter text in a larger text box for increased visibility and ease of use.

# Key Generation:
The key can be Generated from the Code file Given for key Generation this Will Create a key.bin file in your Working Directory. Key Should be with both the Sender and reciver.

# How to Use:

# Encryption:

1 Click on the "Encryption" button.
2 Enter the text to be encrypted in the provided input dialog.
3 Select an image file to hide the encrypted text.
4 The application performs encryption and steganography, providing feedback on successful completion.
# Decryption:

1 Click on the "Decryption" button.
2 Select the image file containing hidden encrypted text.
3 The application extracts and decrypts the text, displaying the result in a text box.
4 Security: CryptoGUI ensures the security of the encrypted text through the robust AES encryption algorithm. Additionally, the use of steganography enhances 5 data security by concealing the encrypted text within the image, adding an extra layer of protection.

CryptoGUI is an excellent tool for users who prioritize a combination of security and user-friendly design. Whether you're looking to securely share sensitive information or explore the world of cryptography, CryptoGUI provides a reliable and elegant solution
